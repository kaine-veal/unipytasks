2.5. Count single, di-nucleotide and tri-nucleotides in a sequence. 

So for sequence:
aggagtaagcccttgcaactggaaatacacccattg

The output would be something like:
- see exercise sheet

Hint - the above examples only count what is present so there are no counts of zero. For bonus 
points find all possible nucleotide combinations in advance then count those that are present. You 
can also provide warnings about incomplete groups of nucleotides at the end of the sequence, e.g. if 
there are two bases at the end when you are counting tri-nucleotides, and deal with gaps or non-standard bases in the input sequence.

Challenge: find the single, di-nucleotide and tri-nucleotide counts for:
